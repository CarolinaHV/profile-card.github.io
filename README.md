## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I knew about handling image sizes for different screens in HTML, but with this challenge I learned how to make them in CSS.


### Continued development

I think the part that was a bit difficult for me was in the positioning of some images and the part of putting the responsive design. But it was fun to be the first challenge I did.
